                    I am passionate about technology. It's rapid evolution and endless application excites me.
                    I can often be found tinkering with new tech. As founding member of Michigan State's 
                    Girls Who Code Club I am able to share this love with the next generation of software 
                    engineers. As a daughter of an educator, community outreach and education are very important to me.

                    Design has been a passion of mine throughout life. This, along with my love for technology has 
                    lead to my interest in UX/UI. I believe that technology should be visually appealing, intuitive, and 
                    accessible. In my free time, I enjoy being creative. I'm interested in all mediums that allow me 
                    to explore this! My favorite mediums include watercolor painting, drawing, and cross stitching.

                    I grew up in Northern Michigan, so I love the outdoors and the lake! A few of my favorite
                    outdoor activities: running, hiking, kayaking, and biking. I am also a big fan of basketball,
                    specifically, Michigan State's team! During the season, you can find me cheering on MSU. Go Green!
